Section Two:
** a. You receive a security alert through GuardDuty noting suspicious outbound traffic to a strange IP from an EC2 instance in the dev environment. What would be your approach to investigating this potential risk?

Solution:
1. I will review the specific GuardDuty finding to understand whether it's truly malicious traffic or potentially a misconfigured legitimate request.

2. I will check the IP address using a tool such as IPinfo.io to get the owner of the IP address and other details. Is it a known malicious IP or associated with any legitimate service

3. I will check VPC Flow Logs to analyze the network traffic patterns for the EC2 instance to see the source, destination and type of traffic being sent to the suspicious IP.

4. I will SSH into the EC2 instance and review SSH access logs or check for any unusual login activities.

5. I will check application logs and AWS CloudTrail logs for unusual API calls or activities associated with the instance.

6. If the suspicious activity continues, I will remove the instance from the internet (disable public IP) and temporarily disable security group rules to block outbound traffic.

7. If the instance is compromised, I will terminate the instance and launch a new one. I will also replace sensitive credentials (like IAM roles, SSH keys) and review instance configurations to prevent similar issues in the future.
